# Predicting-Mortality-of-ICU-Patients-the-PhysioNet-Computing-in-Cardiology-Challenge-2012
	Used R to create SAPS score for individual 14 variables using SAPS-I and SAPS-II table for 4000 patients and calculated SAPS patient score for the initial 24 hours after admission in ICU. 
	Used 10-fold cross validation on Logistic Regression method to calculate the probability of mortality for patients and achieved 85.92% and 86.68% accuracy for SAP-I and SAPS-II.
	Used Tableau to find anomalies, trends and key metrics to evaluate the variables responsible for mortality of patients.
	Currently developing ETL tools to enable automated data acquisition using R from MIMIC III for analysing of large patient data.
